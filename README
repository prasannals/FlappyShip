You'll see a map with earthquakes of the past week represented on the map using markers. On top of the map, you'll see a ship which constantly keeps falling down. Your job is to guide the ship towards the other end of the screen. You do this by using SPACE bar. Space bar make the ship jump up a little. You have to guide the ship and make sure it doesn't get too close to the earthquakes(else, it's game over). Also, the ship shouldn't fall below the lower border of the app.

This is built using the Processing library for Java and UnfoldingMaps extension for Processing. The CommonMarker class provides an abstract class upon which CityMarker and EarthquakeMarker are built. The LandQuakeMarker and OceanQuakeMarker extend EarthquakeMarker adding land quake and ocean quake specific properties to the markers. The EarthquakeCityMap is the class which extends PApplet to create the Applet. The UnfoldingMaps map uses OpenStreetMaps provider to display the map.
